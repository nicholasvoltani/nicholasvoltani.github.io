up:: [[Boundary (Topology)]]

Let $S \subseteq X$ be a subset of a [[Topological Space]] $(X, \tau)$.

Then its boundary is 
$$\partial S = \overline{S} \setminus \mathring{S} = \overline{S} \cap \mathring{S}^C$$
Since the [[Set Complement|Complement]] of an open set is a closed set ─ and the [[Closure (Topology)|Closure]] is a closed set, and the [[Interior (Topology)|Interior]] is an open set─, we have an intersection of closed sets, which yields a closed set.

Thus, the boundary of a set is closed.
