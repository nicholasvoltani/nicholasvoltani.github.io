up:: [[Equivalence Relation]]

Given an [[Equivalence Relation]] $\sim$ over a set $X$, an equivalence class is the set of all points equivalent to each other (under $\sim$). We usually denote all equivalence classes by $[x]$, choosing some $x$ inside it to represent it.

Note that [[All equivalence classes are disjoint]], since having a single point in common would make them both equivalent.
