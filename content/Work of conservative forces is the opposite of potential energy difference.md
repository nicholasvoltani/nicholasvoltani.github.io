> The work done by a conservative force releases/accumulates potential energy, depending on whether it follows a path alongside/opposite to the field lines.

# Proof
For a [[Conservative Force]] $\vec{F}$, with potential $V(\vec{r})$, we have that it exerts work on a particle at a path $L$ as
$$
W = \int_L \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{l} = - \int_L \vec{\nabla} V \cdot d\vec{l}
$$
By the [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]], we have that it results into
$$
W = -\left(V(\vec{r_2}) - V(\vec{r_1})\right) \equiv - \Delta V
$$
