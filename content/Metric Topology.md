up:: [[Metric Space]]

It is defined as the set of all [[Open Sets in Metric Spaces]], i.e. the set of all sets $A$ whose points have some [[Open Balls (Metric Spaces)]] also interior to $A$. Thus, [[The metric topology is generated by open balls]].

Note that [[Topological spaces are generalizations of metric space topologies]]; that is, these properties of metric topologies motivated the more general definition of [[Topological Space]]s.

Note that, when seen as topological spaces (with their metric topologies), [[All metric spaces are Hausdorff spaces]], since all points are separated by a distance of, say, $d(x,y)/2$.
