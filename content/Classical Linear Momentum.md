Given a particle of mass $m$ and velocity $\vec{v}$, its momentum is defined as
$$\vec{p} = m \vec{v}$$
When considering a system of particles, the total momentum is related to the [[Center of Mass]], since
$$\vec{P} = \sum\limits_{i}m_i \vec{v}_i = \sum\limits_{i}m_i \frac{d\vec{v}_i}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\sum\limits_{i}m_i \vec{r_i} = M \frac{d\vec{R}}{dt}$$
where $M$ is the total system's mass and $\vec{R}$ is the center of mass.
