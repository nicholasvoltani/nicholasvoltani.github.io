up:: [[Finitely Generated Vector Space]]

Let $(V, +, \cdot)$ be a [[Vector Space]], with [[Spanning Set]] $S = \{s_1, \dots, s_n\}$. Let $U = \{u_1, \dots, u_m\} \subseteq V$ be a [[Linear Independence|Linearly Independent]] set. We seek to prove that $m \leq n$.

> We seek to prove that, by adequate arrangements, exchanges of vectors of $S$ with vectors from $U$ still make the new set a spanning set, since each vector removed can be seen as the linear combination of the remainder of the vectors (thus, "no information is lost").

**Proof by Induction**: removing a vector from $S$ and adding a vector from $U$ still makes their union a spanning set.
- $k=1$: $S \cup \{u_1\}$ is [[Linear Dependence|Linearly Dependent]] and spans $V$. Since [[A set is linearly dependent iff there is a vector which is a linear combination of previous vectors]], then we can rearrange the new set and remove some vector from $S$ such that this union still spans $V$ ─ say, removing $s_n$[^1] ─ yielding $\{u_1, s_1, \dots, s_{n-1}\}$.
- $k-1 \implies k$: Suppose that $\{u_1, \dots, u_{k-1}, s_1, \dots, s_{n-k-1}\}$ is still a spanning set, after having swapped $k-1$ vectors from $S$ for $k-1$ vectors from $U$ (provided adequate arrangements). Since it spans $V$, then we have that, in particular,
$$u_k = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k-1}\alpha_i u_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-k-1} \tilde{\alpha}_i s_i$$
Note that we must have some $\tilde{\alpha}_i$ different than $0$, since else it would make $\{u_1, \dots, u_k\}$ linearly independent[^2] ─ let it be $\tilde{\alpha}_k$. Then we have
$$s_k = \frac{1}{\tilde{\alpha}_k} \left(u_k -\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k-1}\alpha_i u_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-k-2} \tilde{\alpha}_i s_i\right)$$
Thus, $s_k$ is in the span of $\{u_1, \dots, u_k, s_1, \dots, s_{n-k-2}\}$. As a consequence, this new set will still span $V$ (since it contains all vectors which, per hypothesis, span $V$).

At the end, we'll have the set $U \cup \{s_1, \dots, s_{n-m}\}$ which spans $V$. Note that, if $m > n$, we'd run out of spanning vectors $S$ and would be forced to remove vectors from $U$ themselves ─ which would make it [[Linear Dependence|Linearly Dependent]], contradiction.

Thus we must have that $m \leq n$.

[^1]: This works since $s_k$ will be substituted by the span of the remaining vectors ─ and, thus, this new set will still span the entire set, just with $\{u_1, s_1, \dots, s_{n-1}\}$ instead of with $\{s_1, \dots, s_n\}$.
