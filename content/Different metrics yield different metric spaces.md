Metric spaces with same set but different [[Metric Function]]s can be seen as different spaces altogether.

Consider, as in the image above, $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the euclidean metric
$$
d_E(u, v) = \sqrt{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (u_i - v_i)^2}
$$
and the taxi-cab metric
$$
d_1(u, v) = \sum\limits_i |u_i - v_i|
$$
Note that $\color{red} red$, $\color{blue} blue$ and $\color{yellow} yellow$ distances are all equivalent shortest distances under the $L_1$ distance, while the shortest distance in the Euclidean metric is the $\color{green} green$ path.
