up:: [[Linear Momentum Conservation Theorem]]

When the sum of external forces is equal to $0$, we have that **the system's total momentum**
$$\vec{P} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n m_i v_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n m_i \frac{d\vec{r}_i}{dt} = M \frac{d\vec{R}}{dt}$$
**is conserved**.

In this case, the [[Center of Mass]] is moving uniformly â”€ regardless whether its constituent particles aren't!
