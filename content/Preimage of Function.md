Given a function $f: X \to Y$ and a subset $B \subseteq Y$, we have that its preimage is the set of all points in $f$'s domain mapping onto it. 

Formally, it is
$$
f^{-1}(B) = \{x \in X \mid f(x) \in B\}
$$

When talking about points in the preimage of some subset, 
$$
x \in f^{-1}(B) \iff \exists y \in B \mid f(x) =y \iff f(x) \in B
$$
# Properties
- [[The preimage of the union is the union of the preimages]]
- [[The preimage of the intersection is the intersection of the preimages]]
- [[The preimage of the complement is the complement of the preimage]]
