Given a [[Metric Space]] $(X, \tau)$ and some set $A \subset X$, then $A$ is said to be open if, for all points $x \in A$, there exist some [[Open Balls (Metric Spaces)|open ball]] $B_{r_x}(x)$ with radius $r_x$ dependent on $x$.

The set of all open sets in a metric space (as defined above) is called the [[Metric Topology]], or metric-induced topology.

# Generalization to Topological Spaces
Instead of thinking about open sets as being dependent on the metric structure of a space (i.e. containing some open ball around its points), a [[Topology]] is already the set which contains all open sets from the get-go.
