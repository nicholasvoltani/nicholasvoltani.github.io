A function $f: (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$ between [[Topological Space]]s is said to be a homeomorphism if it is a [[Bijective Function]] which is [[Topologically Continuous Function|Topologically Continuous]] both ways.

# Relation to topological invariants
Homeomorphisms preserve some topological properties, which are said to be [[Topological Invariant]]s.
