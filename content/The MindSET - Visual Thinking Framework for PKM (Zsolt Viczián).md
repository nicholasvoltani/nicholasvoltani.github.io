# Objective
To be able to collect information, find it and actively turn it into new knowledge.

# The MindSET Framework
Allows for a "4D PKM" system:
- to have **linked notes**
- for notes to be **visual notes**

# Zettelkasten vs Evergreen
Zettelkasten is about atomic notes, which can be extended one by one by further cards.

Common ideas with Evergreen:
- Store and develop ideas
- Concept Oriented
- Extended over time
	- But Evergreen notes **regularly updates notes** based on updated understanding
	- Zettelkasten *extends related notes thread* instead

**MOCs are a form of Evergreen notes**

Evergreen notes:
- Communities may collaborate to create Evergreen notes
- Also atomic
- Templates are a special class of Evergreen notes
