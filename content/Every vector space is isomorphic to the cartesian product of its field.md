up:: [[Vector Space]]

Given a vector space $(V, +, \cdot)$ of [[Finitely Generated Vector Space Dimension|Dimension]] $n$ over a [[Field (Algebra)|Field]] $\mathbb{K}$, we have that $V$ is [[Vector Space Isomorphism|Isomorphic]] to $\mathbb{K}^n$, since [[Every vector space with same dimension are isomorphic to each other]].
