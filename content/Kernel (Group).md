Given a mapping between [[Group (Mathematics)|groups]] $\varphi: G \to G'$, its kernel is defined as its "null space", i.e. all elements which are mapped to the identity
$$\ker \varphi = \{k \in G \mid \varphi(k) = e_{G'}\}$$
Equivalently, it is the inverse image of the identity 
$$\ker\varphi = \varphi^{-1}(e_{G'}) \subset G$$
