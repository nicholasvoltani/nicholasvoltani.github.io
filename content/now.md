# 2024
## June 2024
My plan for this month was to refactor a lot of my notes in my Obsidian (and, ergo, Digital Garden), starting from my [[011 MOC Marx|Marxism notes]]. I'm (re)reading through "Das Kapital I" (in Portuguese, of course) and refining/changing old notes and creating new ones where necessary. 

I also began a course on Freelance Translation. I began subtitling videos from the [Complexity Explorer](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/), which is something VERY humbling for me!! Becoming a member of the Santa Fe Institute is an impossible dream for me, a mere lowly Third-World-Country peasant; how dare I dream such heretical [reasonless dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleep_of_Reason_Produces_Monsters)? Regardless, be they futile or foreshadowing, through dreams and illusions my days drudge on. If *someone* from SFI would allow me to participate in one of their programs, you know, that'd be super neat... as if doing voluntary work (especially as a lowly foreigner etc etc) amounts to being worthy of any pity in America, as if! Well, worth a shot.

Anyways, here are the videos that I've subtitled this month (my babies!):
- **Maximum Entropy Methods** course:
	- [Maximum Entropy Tutorial: Intro To Max Ent - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YEn9QRy3ks&list=PLF0b3ThojznT3olRuplp5x41wUp_LZxHL&index=1)
	- [Maximum Entropy Methods Tutorial: A Simple Example: The Taxicab - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P58wHbWXBU&list=PLF0b3ThojznT3olRuplp5x41wUp_LZxHL&index=2)
	- 
	- 
	- [Maximum Entropy Methods Tutorial: MaxEnt applied to Taxicab Example Part 2 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9aWmecOJxQ&list=PLF0b3ThojznT3olRuplp5x41wUp_LZxHL&index=6)
		- Even a correction to the English subtitle, from anyone who wrote "[unaudible]"... [pathetic.jpg](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.imageresizer.com%2Fimages%2Fmemes%2FPathetic-meme-10.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=16dcf5837f02edc68ec82d3b3d6a5e6b1eb876ff6b7c5b9d1cac06961913a37c&ipo=images)

**Interesting content of the month:**
- [Home-Cooked Software and Barefoot Developers (Maggie Appleton)](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software): an interesting analogy between "[barefoot doctors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_doctor)" and software developers, and how we need more developers apt to create solutions for less general, more specific problems
- [When to Design for Emergence (Kasey Klimes)](https://newsletter.rhizomerd.com/p/when-to-design-for-emergence): a very interesting take on designing for things/products/systems which are, so to say, "free from its creators' clutches"
	- I wrote a bit about it in [[Design for Emergence]] etc. There's **a lot** that revolutionaries MUST learn from this idea ‚Äì hell, even the whole marxist idea that "we can't predict how revolutions will turn out" is predicated on this idea: if it were known from the start, then there'd be little free will in its doing; it must be done *in situ*, so to say, it must come from its own material terms and hands and conditions and culture, etc. And for changes to take root, the ground must be fertile for it to stay put, or else things will go back to how they were: comfortably uncomfortable.
- [Art Won't Save Us from Capitalism - Lily Alexandre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oTzg2R3RcY): a TERRIFIC video essay on the role of art within capitalism, and how it does ‚Äì and doesn't ‚Äì "change the world" effectively. GREAT meta-analysis as well. Some great further references from the video:
	- [The Case Against Art? - Mitch Speed](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ovok773l545gars7nvxkk/The_Case_Against_Art.pdf?rlkey=j4h1eu1l1t8ase5vnj5eum4hv&e=1&dl=0)
	- Pedagogia do Oprimido, do Paulo Freire... **as should be**! It's becoming harrowing for me to be Brazilian and having never read (one of the) most worldly-recognized Brazilian writer(s), who's cited by so many foreigners who didn't even read it in Freire's mother tongue, which is my own...
	- > "As a cultural worker who belongs to an oppressed people, **my job is to make revolution irresistible**." (Toni Cade Bambara, [apud Alexandre](https://youtu.be/0oTzg2R3RcY?t=1808)) 

Oh, and I got hyperfocused in Mario Superstar Baseball videos [from Dinger City](https://www.youtube.com/@DingerCity) on YouTube, thanks to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUZ1QDOFX-k). Didn't like Dinger City at first, but it grew on me overtime. 

## May 2024
I participated in the [ICTP ‚Äì SAIFR ¬ª Workshop on Dynamical Processes on Complex Networks](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/wdpcn2024/) in S√£o Paulo. It was *fascinating*, and illuminated that I truly want to pursue some research in Complex Systems ‚Äì the more interdisciplinary, the merrier! Even if I end up not doing research on it (as seems to be the harsh truth...), I do believe it is a paradigm revolution just in its infancy still.

Speaking of research, I'm searching (**again**) for an advisor for my Master's degree. It's like banging my head against the wall, thankfully metaphorically: all professors seem to be full to the brim with ill-paid, nowhere-else-to-go-anyways post-graduates, and so there's no room and/or no scholarships available for me. [Oh Joy of Joys!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-sXlwV5xL8)

I'm also hyperfocusing on Drums at the moment: I'll be performing [Black Sheep (from the Scott Pilgrim movie)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xcSDYy3Dl4) at the school I'm having lessons in, in July. Kinda challenging and *fast*, but *doable*, and extremely fun to play ‚Äì especially [this part](https://youtu.be/ArkDWrHmmXI?t=83)!

**Interesting content of the month:**
- [Meatball Wiki: MeatballWiki](http://meatballwiki.org/): Very interesting example of a collaborative wiki. It's based on what they call [Meatball Wiki: BarnRaising](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/BarnRaising), which is their way of turning the usually-anonymous way of collaborating on the Internet into a more personal and *social* matter. They do it by allowing for users to attach their opinions on the Wiki's posts right at the post's end, and by only keeping users *that share their names explicitly*.
- [Maggie Appleton's Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/): the most beautiful website I've had the pleasure to witness, in my entire life probably.

## April 2024
On April 1st, I officially left my job in an Agro Insurance company which sucked out my soul with a metaphorical straw. 

I went back to my parents' house in the "countryside" of S√£o Paulo, to have a break from S√£o Paulo's urban pandemonium. I essentially took time to decompress and focus on my particular interests, in particular writing and putting up my Digital Garden with Quartz.

I also got my Autism pre-diagnosis, which was already expected but, now, official; I posted an [essay/manifesto/rant about it](https://medium.com/@nicholasvoltani/mas-voc%C3%AA-nem-parece-autista-1f943cd234c2) on Medium. Speaking of Medium, I also posted some poems, *quasi-post-festum*, for this year's [Escapril](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3-qBQlsNvu/).

I began (again) my drums lessons (I began in January 2024, but stopped due to moving).
## March 2024
Just running around to deliver everything that was within my responsabilities in my job before officially quitting.

## February 2024
HUGE meltdown, which made it crystal clear that I should quit my job. Not much, just in a soul-crushing job, away from friends, etc.
## January 2024
Huge letdowns from my Marxist comrades! Let's all sit down and read [Comrade: An Essay on Political Belonging, by Jodi Dean](https://www.amazon.com/Comrade-Political-Belonging-Jodi-Dean/dp/1788735013), why don't we!? üòçüòç
# 2023
Essentially a dead year, suffocated by my job. I attempted a Social Sciences course in the beginning of the year, but working a job and enrolling a course designed for young, non-working individuals... it was short-lived, and not worth my burning-out.

The one gasp for air that I had was in November, when I attended the [ICTP ‚Äì SAIFR ¬ª School on Mathematical Modeling and Governance](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/mmg2023/) in S√£o Paulo, which was *phenomenal*! The most interesting papers related to the speakers' research were:
- [Professor Hern√°n Solari's Lecture Notes for this event](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_IJTcNrUBk2rJvvmn4kQ9E2t7aLa1jXp/view?usp=sharing). In particular the philosophical/epistemological part is just outstandingly interesting! Professor Solari is just an OUTSTANDINGLY GENIUS guy, the smartest person I've met, from the few emails that we've exchanged. Other papers of his that have captivated me are:
	- [Science, Dualities and the Phenomenological Map | Foundations of Science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10699-022-09850-4), that elucidate the processes of abstraction and "reconstruction" of ideas. In particular, it's essentially the very same process that Marxists talk about when it comes to abstractions of reality and "concrete totalities"; it's essentially the process through which we do Science, in general!
	- [¬øCrisis de la ciencia o crisis civilizatoria?](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hernan-Solari/publication/362989302_Crisis_de_la_ciencia_o_crisis_civilizatoria/links/63099abd1ddd447021102967/Crisis-de-la-ciencia-o-crisis-civilizatoria.pdf), in which it falls JUST THIS short from explicitly saying "Capitalism is destroying Science"
	- His papers on Philosophy of Physics: [On the relation of free bodies, inertial sets and arbitrariness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08885) and [On the persistence of the ether as absolute space (Solari & Natiello)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hernan-Solari/publication/339398909_On_the_persistence_of_the_ether_as_absolute_space/links/5eaff7f045851592d6b86a8b/On-the-persistence-of-the-ether-as-absolute-space.pdf) (both of which I should (re)read again)
- [Winged promises: Exploring the discourse on transgenic mosquitoes in Brazil (Luiza Reis-Castro)](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/64587902/reis13-transgenic-oxitec-social-libre.pdf?1601733224=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DWinged_promises_Exploring_the_discourse.pdf&Expires=1718073050&Signature=JQQwVc~vUjqYIjoakobH-L~Eqwerybjex9ED4jmE9LiInHxeeUXIskXgHBvUbbrKgWkkN2ZxgssRkGeASRWSuQCnj4bpK-c0INh1-mrej18CtK2LFKAaGumO4Vm3QbnA~Md8yLGI7aVGtJjCc~~bmRJ8wEBvJ8nnjqNTCatX7Vuowamb3BsSsFLY~jkOu3pFXg8Ejeq5H-8nSIwlzvVxwKzwXNbMPFiPOBc9GrmGBzKm0ywbUm6Ir7BXvcrsbLkoFk5X3Aa8ZXWsTDyfUzZdfRWzL3DZdHMM1~W8C5dBeuye7nK-sik3KeK-6JVvWtZchD~rAF4o9CBTKClpYP1Uvw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) and [Becoming Without- Making Transgenic Mosquitoes and Disease Control in Brazil (Luiza Reis-Castro)](https://watermark.silverchair.com/323reiscastro.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAA3kwggN1BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggNmMIIDYgIBADCCA1sGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMUJSutsZVXPGlDh17AgEQgIIDLL6TbukgWuPoHRzc7fAOOZVTOuzm9NpaC4a3eTgN1HKImto80wtwsk7_l96Wliq9VC1YJbPXk0UZmjhpFdVbSc5FS1ZlU_sgO2mFeVWznIV8mfIP7ZwLu-9QIwuZQqhdht-DgzFYWd92GpwO_R_oT8XYK8y9YqWynQKwOhK0huChSQ7Jhz2U3h5nA5Uje_UJ-_wSO26-XHY-Xf2bf_cF_z3-GK3_R6GxaWWaTx-mCW6rIxOauRstavteA4zq_wOVdqCyphjDtM_trLyj-3CaYS9Tq8CDMkZZ-tWpfEmdnTri3bxAQTyu1YifZ-I0ZNgUUz9grRozYtjh38-h2fYxPait9bbVy-MzumdtlELjN4P-N_2I9-jIF1Z95ovk7gp8ysoAZjo0UgLWZYZNdgfx4wCiATN9OaHzLSajsJWyDCRI6g0AW-DHnGakBeMCpWg-amYNhYUdVd3Zk6ZKMIfnS0UjPbFgFY4f5MKHLzmiZe61YvvBJImT884RBxTZ_5hgJNfIoJg72a36WvGj8aML__47lIYHs-JJrQOZnVlEFhRitTXP803mH42mzT2qaXuAZzgvODPrNTwUn938g2vImiQ9xKpCrKlxji50zk3REy5JG-qQZ115vSrLhMhadtvUcRdlGfRqwcq4NgQZ_z5Bfd21awGKfOD7sc7OmD3T6oBbCce6AL0m2MJk8ouMkp7d8eb9s4o7EiQOqoqMuO3FIaqyOjN4jFuMZSQOrmBADleyT5cdlhXT7PJL64ukncgSYUCfemeXq34fui6UM045zVfTKrDn_Lg2oyVcJ4hUvQvMZx0PqaPQ_GNzzztFV--vcR9CY4melKz6vx-gJ3C82Cx8D-UAuCGs0oyipe9BppPa6Zx8-lsri9wgEUWEtcH012xkvh0Hzcuat7BMC_qoIzPH8ces8pAEU_2mqjhJUo7amBVk9ly4Qt86NMybgy0SiRjA92GriHEcvI_MX9W9rLQq4OXMoDZ_zQ44qvGS_klqp6zvIo99-m5aHRzDXO_6VMRETU1HEthTriZmfcyUXqxW4z8uox3FH-Nu-NNkIn4KieNG7ccpxpYFHCcY). Luiza Reis-Castro is an Anthropologist, and performed an ethnographic research on the scientific enterprise of breeding genetically modified *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes in the Northeast region of Brazil ‚Äì a region so poor that, ironically or not (when it comes to mosquito proliferation), the city in which she resided in **didn't even have piped water**! Talk about a labcoat version of Environmental Racism, to perform scientific research in a place so poor that it has no choice but to conform...
- [The rock-paper-scissors game and the evolution of alternative male strategies (Sinervo & Lively)](http://149.156.165.8/ekol-ewol/Sinervo%20&%20Lively%201996%20-%20rock-paper-scissors.pdf): a BIOLOGICAL (non-human) example of a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, i.e. a system in which there are 3 strategies that form a dominance cycle (Rock < Paper < Scissors < Rock < $\dots$). Short and interesting!
- The one-page long "paper" from Alvin Weinberg, [Science and Trans-Science](https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.177.4045.211), which puts the discussion of the "limits of science" on the table. The creation of the [concept handle](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3b7sidNrEkNaY9qfGwZjwz) "trans-science" validates and crystallizes the influence that non-scientific people have, not in the scientific endeavor *per se*, but on a lateral, not-scientific-but-not-unscientific knowledge creation and, perhaps most important, governance and sociopolitical decisions.
