up:: [[Coset]]

Let $G$ be a [[Group (Mathematics)|Group]] and $N \leq G$ be a [[Subgroup (Mathematics)|Subgroup]] of $G$.

By hypothesis, left cosets equal right cosets, which means that, for a given $g \in G$, $gN = Ng$.

That is, given $n \in N$, $gn = ng \implies gn g^{-1} \in N$.

Thus, $N$ is a [[Normal Subgroup]].
