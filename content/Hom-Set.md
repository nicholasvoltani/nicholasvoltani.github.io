Given two objects $X, Y$, we say that the collection of all morphisms from $X$ to $Y$ is the collection $Hom(X,Y)$. That is,
$$
Hom(X, Y) := \{X \overset{f}{\to} Y\}
$$
# Examples
- A [[Vector Space Dual]] is the Hom-Set $Hom(V, \mathbb{K})$ from a [[Vector Space]] $V$ to its [[Field (Algebra)|Field]] $\mathbb{K}$.
- Between every object $X, Y$ inside a category $C$, there is a collection of morphisms $Hom(X, Y)$
- A category is said to be [[Locally Small Category]] when all of its Hom-Sets are, in fact, sets
