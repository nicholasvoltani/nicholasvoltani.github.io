up:: [[Quotient Group]]

Given a [[Group (Mathematics)|Group]] $G$ and a [[Normal Subgroup]] $N \trianglelefteq G$, we can create an [[Equivalence Relation]] in $G$ as
$$g \sim h \iff \exists n \in N \mid g = hn \iff gh^{-1} \in N$$
That is, elements of $N$ act as *identity elements* in the [[Quotient Space]].

We can identify each [[Equivalence Class]] in this quotient space as a left coset of $N$
$$[g] \in G /\sim \;\leftrightarrow gN \in G / N$$
