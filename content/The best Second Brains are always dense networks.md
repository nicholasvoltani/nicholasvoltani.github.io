up:: [[Network Density]]

The best Second Brains/linked thinking personal instances are those that grow in a well-linking fashion, close to the "[neurons that fire together, wire together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory)" adage of neuroscience.

This can be measured (partially) by the graph's [[Network Density|connectance]] $\rho$, which is a measure of how many of all possible links actually exist. 

In particular, this measure is worth measuring as the graph grows (i.e. $N \to \infty$). If $\rho \to 0$, then this graph is said to be **sparse**, which isn't an effective use of linked thinking: there are many notes (nodes) that are being created without linking to enough others. 

Otherwise, this graph is called **dense**: the amount of links created are not falling behind to the increasing amount of created notes. It's the ideal scenario for a "healthy" Second Brain/Zettelkasten/Digital Garden. It's called *linked thinking* for a reason!
