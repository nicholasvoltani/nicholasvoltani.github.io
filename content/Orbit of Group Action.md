up:: [[Group Action]]

![[Pasted image 20230708143146.png|200]]

Given a [[Group Action]] of a [[Group (Mathematics)|Group]] $G$ upon a set $X$, we have that the orbit of a point $x \in X$ is the set of all points in the set which are reached from $x$ after being acted upon by $G$. That is,
$$
Orb_x = \{y \in X \mid \exists g \in G :y = g \cdot x\} \subseteq X
$$

Note that [[Group actions induce an equivalence relation over a set's orbits]], since distinct orbits are disjoint and cover the entire set $X$.
