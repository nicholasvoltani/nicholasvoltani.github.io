Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological Space]], and $Z \subseteq X$ a subset.

Then, since [[All sets are contained inside their closure]], $Z \subseteq \overline{Z}$. 

Since [[Set Complements flip subset ordering]], we have that $\overline{Z}^c \subseteq Z^c$. Since $\overline{Z}$ is closed, $\overline{Z}^c$ is open, and equal to its own [[Interior (Topology)|Interior]]. Thus,
$$(\overline{Z}^c)^\circ = \overline{Z}^c \subseteq (Z^c)^\circ$$
By flipping again with complements, we arrive at
$$\left[(Z^c)^\circ\right]^c \subseteq \overline{Z}$$
which shows a closed set[^1], which is contained inside $Z$'s closure. However, since $\overline{Z}$ is the smallest closed set containing $Z$, then we have that
$$\left[(Z^c)^\circ\right]^c = \overline{Z}$$
