Given an ensemble of particles $\{m_i, \vec{r_i}\}_{i=1}^n$, one defines their center of mass as 
$$
\vec{R} = \frac{\sum\limits_i m_i \vec{r_i}}{\sum\limits_i m_i} = \frac{\sum\limits_i m_i \vec{r_i}}{M} = \sum\limits_i \frac{m_i}{M} \vec{r_i}
$$
where $M = \sum\limits_i m_i$ is the total system's mass. 

The center of mass is essentially a **weighted average** of the position of the particles.
