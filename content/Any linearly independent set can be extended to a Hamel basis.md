up:: [[Linear Independence]]

Given a linearly independent set $S \subset V$ from a [[Vector Space]] $(V, +, \cdot)$, we can extend it to a [[Hamel Basis]] by aggregating vectors outside of its [[Spanning Set|Span]][^1] ─ which guarantees to terminate at the same number of elements of any basis, since [[Every linearly independent set of a finitely generated vector space has at most the same number of vectors as its spanning set]] ─ and, in particular, of Hamel bases. 

Thus, this augmented linearly independent set will also be a spanning set ─ thus, a basis.

[^1]: Since [[The union of a linearly independent set with a vector outside of its span is also linearly independent]].
