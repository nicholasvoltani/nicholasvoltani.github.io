up:: [[Every linearly independent set of a finitely generated vector space has at most the same number of vectors as its spanning set|Steinitz Exchange Lemma]]

Let $(V, +, \cdot)$ be a [[Finitely Generated Vector Space]], with [[Spanning Set]] $S = \{s_1, \dots, s_n\}$. Let $U = \{u_1, \dots, u_m\} \subseteq V$.

From the Steinitz Exchange Lemma, by contrapositive, we have that $m > n$ implies that $U$ is [[Linear Dependence|Linearly Dependent]] (assuming $S$ is a spanning set as hypothesis).
