Given sets $S, X$, we define the complement of $S$ with respect to $X$ as
$$X \setminus S = \{x \in X \mid x \notin S\}$$
In particular cases in which $S \subseteq X$, one denotes this complement as $S^c$, implicitly assuming it is its complement with its superset â”€ which is usually the entire base space.
