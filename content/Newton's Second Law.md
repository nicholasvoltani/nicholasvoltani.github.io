Newton's second law says that, under any [[Inertial Frame of Reference]], a particle's movement is governed by the equation
$$
\sum\limits_i \vec{F_i} = m \frac{d^2 \vec{x}}{dt^2}
$$
where $\sum\limits_i \vec{F_i}$ is the total sum of forces acting upon this particle. 

This pressuposes that **all particles have the same mass on all inertial frames of reference**. Under this hypothesis, this is the same to
$$
\sum\limits_i \vec{F_i} = \frac{d \vec{p}}{dt}
$$
which $\vec{p}$ the [[Classical Linear Momentum]].
