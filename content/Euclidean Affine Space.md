up:: [[Affine Space]]

An affine space $\left(E, \vec{E}, +\right)$ is said to be an Euclidean affine space when its underlying vector space $\vec{E}$ is a [[Euclidean Vector Space]] with a [[Metric Function]] in $E$ (induced from its [[Inner Product]] $\left<\cdot, \cdot\right>$). 

That is, given any points $P, Q \in E$ (i.e. separated by a vector $\vec{PQ} \in \vec{E}$), their distance can be defined as
$$\rho(P, Q) = ||\vec{PQ}|| = \sqrt{\left<\vec{PQ}, \vec{PQ}\right>}$$

This structure is meant to represent physical space â”€ in particular [[Reference Frame|Newtonian Reference Frame]]s.
