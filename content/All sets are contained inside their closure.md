up:: [[Closure (Topology)]]

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological Space]], and $S \subseteq X$.

Then, by the definition of [[Closure (Topology)]], we know that $\overline{S}$ is the intersection of closed sets which enclose $S$. 

Since all of them enclose $S$, their intersection will also enclose $S$. The "upper bound" of its closure is $X$ itself, since $X$ is closed; the "lower bound" is $S$ itself, since all closed sets involved enclose $S$; thus, $S \subseteq \overline{S} \subseteq X$.
