# 202206191055 - 10 commandments of Type III Ecosystems
> "Complex systems (...) are not 'run' by anyone in particular, but are instead controlled by **countless individual interactions** that occur **inside** the system" (p. 253; grifo meu)

## 1. Use waste as a resource
> "One of the key lessons from systems ecology is that as a system puts on **more biomass** (total living weight), it needs **more recycling loops** to keep it from collapsing" (p. 254; grifo meu)

That is, for a system to be more resilient, it needs to become more **self-contained**, less reliant on external systems for its day-to-day functioning (aside from its primary source of energy, which comes from the Sun). That is, it should strive to have as less unusable waste as possible ─ that is, it should strive to produce **reusable byproducts** (if not to the part that produced it, then to another part in the ecosystem) as much as possible (aside from the physical limitation of heat production).

> "All waste is food, and everybody winds up reincarnated inside somebody else"


## 2. Diversify and Cooperate to fully use the habitat
Diversity operates on the notion of **dynamic stability**:
> "if one organism drops out of the network, there's usually a backup, allowing the web to stay whole" (p. 258)

Cooperation can either be **implicit** (animals "feeding at different times of day", territorial behavior) or **explicit** (species operate upon "mutual benefit").

Michiyuki Uenohara gives the analogy that we have plenty of "**arteries**" in our economies (pushing products from producing units into the market) but **not enough "veins"** (returning material back to the producing units); it also operates upon the notion of "using waste as a resource".

Interesting movements mentioned:
* "Design for Disassembly" of companies in a "pre-competitive" moment
* Japan's "Ecofactory Initiative"


## 3. Gather and Use Energy Efficiently
> "Not everything needed by industry can be recycled, however.
> Even in a natural system, only **nutrients and minerals** can be circulated through the diverse connections of an ecosystem; **energy cannot**." (p. 261)

Therefore, there must be an **initial energy import** from **outside** the system: that's where the sun and **photosynthesis** comes in, with a 95% efficiency of photons-to-chemical-bonds.

> "those who overuse or squander energy are eventually edited out of the gene pool" (p. 261)

Aside from the efficient **intake** (*gathering*) of energy, it's also important to **use** energy efficiently, which natural organisms do by the use of **enzymes**:
> "Biological catalysts also allow nature to **manufacture benignly**: instead of using high heats and harsh chemicals to create or break bonds, nature manufactures **at room temperature and in water**.
> The physics of falling together and falling apart ─ the natural drive toward self-assembly ─ does all the work." (p. 261)

Natural systems attest to the importance of efficiently using **current** sunlight, instead of relying upon **ancient** sunlight (i.e. fossil fuels). 

The use of **high fluxes of energy** can lead to "nest fouling"; that is why, for instance, "poisonous snakes don't store their toxins in bulk; instead, they create small batches only when needed".

## 4. Optimize rather than maximize
> "In a mature mode, organisms are rewarded for **being efficient** and learning to **do more with less**.
> Those that survive are those that **live within their means**." (p. 263)

Type III ecosystems grow fast in the beginning, but **slow down as they mature**, as there are more individuals in their same environment. In the beginning, they seek to **maximize their throughput** (that is why inner rings inside tree trunks are further apart from the center: because they grow fast in a short period); as they mature, they seek to **optimize their metabolism**.

## 5. Use materials sparingly
> "Organisms build for durability, but they don't overbuild.
> They **fit form to function**, building exactly what is needed, with the **bare minimum of materials and fuss**." (p. 265)

And not just one function, but possibly **many** functions within the same structure, thus needing **fewer devices to be built for survival**.

## 6. Don't Foul Their Nests
> "Organisms must eat, breathe, and sleep **right in their manufacturing facility, their habitat**; they can't afford to poison themselves." (p. 267)

Such as "*poisonous snakes don't store their toxins in bulk; instead, they create small batches only when needed*", we should strive to
1. Produce naturally, "*at room temperature and in water*";
2. If necessary to use heavy chemicals, to do so in a "chemical-on-demand" fashion

Doing so, we prevent all the ruckus about "minimizing risks" *a posteriori*; instead, we cut the problem at its root! Much simpler.

## 7. Don't Draw Down Resources
> "Organisms in a mature ecosystem live on **harvestable** interest, not principal. 
> The best predator, for instance, is the one that **doesn't completely eliminate its prey**.
> Likewise, the prudent parasite doesn't kill its host.
> Given the room, buffaloes will roam methodically rather than 'nub down' their grassy prairies;
> giraffes will wander from acacia to acacia;
> and even voracious gorillas will move slowly through the jungle, allowing food plants to grow back in behind them.
> All have learned, through the wisdom of their genes, that gouging their growing stock is not a good idea." (p. 269)

The very idea that ecosystems consist of zero-sum games is absurd; the ecosystem thrives on the **dynamics of the interactions**, not on the triumph of one over the others. 

Likewise, it should point out that renewable resources are the most valuable of all, and should be preserved at all costs; since they are self-renewing, they should be kept at all costs, instead of mowed down for profit. 

Non-renewable resources should only be used as much as there is research on **how to substitute them for renewables**.

## 8. Remain in Balance with the Biosphere
> "The biosphere (the layer of air, land and water that supports life) is a **closed system**, meaning that **no materials** (except for rogue meteorites) **are imported or exported**. The stocks of the major biochemical building blocks such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus stay pretty much the same, even though they are **actively traded among organisms**.
> Whatever is removed from the resource reservoirs, through the process of photosynthesizing, respiring, growing, mineralizing, and decaying, is replaced in equal amounts.
> Through the revolving door of organisms, **the stocks circulate but they don't run down**." (p. 271)

Not only is it a closed system, but it has its own **subcycles** within the whole (e.g. carbon cycle, water cycle), and remaining in balance with the biosphere is about not only **operating upon a closed-system fashion**, but also **respecting the inherent cycles and rhythms** of nature.

## 9. Run on Information
> "What makes a mature community run is **not one universal message** being broadcast from above, but **numerous, even redundant, messages** coming from the grass roots, **dispersed throughout the community structure**.
> A rich feedback system allows changes in one component of the community to reverberate through the whole, allowing for adaptation when the environment changes.
> The *raison d'être* of mature communities, remember, is to **maintain their identity throughout environmental storms and travails**, so they can remain, and evolve, in place." (p. 274)

The efficiency with which an ecosystem receives, and then acts upon, information input coming from external sources can dictate whether it will thrive or go extinct ─ these can be changes in the weather, or in nutrients in the soil, or external predators, even its own self-destructive behavior, etc. 

The more freely, and less hampered by hierarchical, bureaucratic networks, the better and faster the entire ecosystem will receive the incoming information, and be able to act upon it; it's already a known property of (mathematical) more connected graphs (for instance, check [**Collaboration and Creativity: The Small World Problem** (Uzzi & Spiro, 2005)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.1086/432782.pdf?casa_token=-JdDvgppLjcAAAAA:kozgJkJwWG7IPCokChor237pwFw4N2oF_MUMuCZZSu99J641vSznEQN8FyCGJwNXvRKmr96wC7EkCGzo7LSZ18IRyhYaf0TaQ43XwOODz0Yf5kJ_kIzFeQ)).

## 10. Shop Locally
> "Biological communities are, by and large, **localized or relatively closely connected in time and space**. Thus, for example, the nutrients in a rotting log are carried into the soil by rainwater, using energy from sunlight captured as the water initially evaporated. 
> **The energy flux is low, the distances proximate**." (Allenby and Cooper, *apud* Benyus, p. 276)

This has to do with the "use energy efficiently" lesson, since ecosystems prefer to use energy locally than to use it for long distances (that is, they prefer to use as little energy as necessary). Just because we *can* build products in many different parts of the world, doesn't mean we *should*.

This also creates local resilience, since the local systems don't rely on long-range influences, which require time to deliver materials as well as information (even the information that they won't receive what they require). Rather, natural ecosystems become **local experts**, *living within their means*.
