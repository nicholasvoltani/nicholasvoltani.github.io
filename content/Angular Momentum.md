**Given an origin $O$**, a particle with position $\vec{r}_O$ and momentum $\vec{p}$ has angular momentum
$$\vec{l} = \vec{r}_O \times \vec{p}$$
Note that it is determined by the common plane of $\vec{r}_O$ and $\vec{p}$.

# Properties
- [[Angular momentum is composed of intrinsic angular momentum and center of mass angular momentum]]
- [[Only external forces exert torque upon a center of mass]]
