up:: [[Every linearly independent set of a finitely generated vector space has at most the same number of vectors as its spanning set|Steinitz Exchange Lemma]]

Given a [[Finitely Generated Vector Space]] $(V, +, \cdot)$, and two [[Hamel Basis]] $\{b_i\}_{i=1}^m, \{b_i'\}_{j=1}^n \subset V$, we have that they're both [[Linear Independence|Linearly Independent]] and both [[Spanning Set]]s. 

Thus we have that $m \leq n$ and $n \leq m$. Thus, they both have the same number of elements.

# Properties
One can thus define the [[Finitely Generated Vector Space Dimension]] $\dim V$ as the cardinality of its bases, since it is unambiguous.
