> "For many mathematicians, the Hausdorff property is like having power in your apartment. Of course, you can build a space without it, but you kind of assume that it will be there. Doing topology without the Hausdorff property feels like stumbling around in the dark." (Evelyn Lamb)

A topological space $(X, \tau)$ is called a Hausdorff space if, for any points $x, y \in X$, there exist open sets $U_x, U_y \in \tau$ such that $x \in U_x \perp U_y \ni y$[^1].

# Corolaries
An easy result is that [[All metric spaces are Hausdorff spaces]].

# Examples of non-Hausdorff spaces
- The line with two origins is a non-trivial example of a non-Hausdorff space: both origins aren't separable by open sets, since they will always have some intersection elsewhere
