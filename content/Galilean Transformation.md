up:: [[Galilean Space]]

A galilean transformation is an [[Affine Map]] from a [[Galilean Space]] $(E, +, \left<\cdot, \cdot\right>)$ to itself, which preserves its [[Galilean Space-time Structure|Galilean Structure]]. 

# Examples of Galilean Transformations
- Since [[Translations in affine spaces are affine automorphisms]], then they're trivially galilean transformations
