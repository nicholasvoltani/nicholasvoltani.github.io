Given a group $G$ and an element $g \in G$, the **left** coset $gG$ is defined as
$$gG = \{gk \mid \forall k \in G\}$$
and the **right** coset $gG$ is defined as 
$$Gg = \{kg \mid \forall k \in G\}$$

In general, left cosets are not equal to right cosets, In fact, we have that [[A subgroup if normal iff its left cosets equal its right cosets]]: they are only equal if the subgroup is a [[Normal Subgroup]].
