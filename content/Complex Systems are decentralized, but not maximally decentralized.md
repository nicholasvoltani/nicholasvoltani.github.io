> "Complex systems (...) are not 'run' by anyone in particular, but are instead controlled by *countless individual interactions* that occur *inside* the system" (BENYUS, p. 253; added emphasis)

A complex system is defined by being a decentralized system: its information is not sent out from a central hub[^1], but rather is composed out of many localized information hubs.

In this sense, it is not centralized, but it's not *completely* decentralized as well: it isn't a cacophony in which every single component is indistinguishable with respect to the whole system. Although qualitatively different and, thus, not comparable *per se*, they all play some role in the system's dynamics.

For instance, in an ecosystem, some species will play the role of "opportunists", such as bacteria, while others will play a role of "$K$-selectors"[^2], such as trees – species with faster and slower metabolic rates, with different roles within the same ecosystem, acting in their own will and, in so doing, maintaining the system's dynamics.

[^2]: Related to the logistic equation $\dot{N} = rN (1-\frac{N}{K})$. $K$-selectors are species whose reproduction aims to maximize offspring life expectancy (higher carrying capacity $K$). On the other side, $r$-selectors (e.g. bacteria) are species which maximize offspring, but at the cost of lower life expectancy.
