A [[Vector Space]] $(V, +, \cdot)$ is said to be finitely generated if it has a **finite** [[Spanning Set]] $S \subseteq V$.

Namely, all elements in $V$ can be generated by a finite [[Linear Combination]] of vectors in $S$, with $S$ itself being finite.

# Properties
- [[Every linearly independent set of a finitely generated vector space has at most the same number of vectors as its spanning set]]
