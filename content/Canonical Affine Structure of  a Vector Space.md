up:: [[Vector Space]]

Let $(\vec{V}, +, \cdot)$ be a vector space over a [[Field (Algebra)|Field]] $\mathbb{K}$. 

Then there is a canonical way of creating an [[Affine Space]] $(A, V, +)$ from it:
- Let the space' set be the set $V$
- Let its underlying vector space be $\vec{V}$
- Let the [[Group Action]] be the additive group $(\vec{V}, +)$

Thus, every vector space can be seen as an affine space over its own set $V$, acted upon by its own additive group $(\vec{V}, +)$.
