A function $f: X \to Y$ is said to be bijective if it induces a one-to-one correspondence between $X$ and $Y$. That is,
$$
\forall y \in Y, \exists! x \in X \mid f(x) = y
$$

That is, $f$ is both an [[Injective Function]] and a [[Surjective Function]].

- A function that is both a bijection and a group homomorphism is called a [[Group Isomorphism]]
- A function that is both a bijection and a continuous function in both directions is said to be a [[Homeomorphism]]
