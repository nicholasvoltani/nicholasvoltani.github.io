The Sierpiński Space is defined over a set with two elements, with the [[Topology]] that only one of those is an open set (the other, thus, is closed). 

Formally, it is the set $S = \{0, 1\}$ whose topology is $\tau_S = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, X\}$.
# Properties
Through the Sierpiński space, one can prove that [[Every topology has a bijection with the Hom-Set of its continuous functions to the Sierpiński space]]: that is, given a topology, each open set has an associated continuous function which "picks it out" from the Sierpiński's space non-trivial open set.
