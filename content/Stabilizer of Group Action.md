up:: [[Group Action]]

Given a [[Group Action]] of a [[Group (Mathematics)|Group]] $G$ upon a set $X$, we have that the stabilizer of a point $x \in X$ is the set of group elements which keep it intact.
$$Stab_x = \{g \in G \mid g \cdot x = x\} \subseteq G$$
# Properties
Note that [[Stabilizers are a subgroup]]. 

In fact, we have that a group action's stabilizers are only trivial iff the group action is a [[Free Group Action]].
