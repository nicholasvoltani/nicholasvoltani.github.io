up:: [[Vector Space]]

Given a vector space $(V, +, \cdot)$, a set $S \subseteq V$ is said to be **linearly independent** if all (finite) [[Linear Combination]]s of its elements are zero only when the coefficients are zero.

That is,
$$\forall \{v_i\} \subset S: \sum\limits_i \alpha_i v_i = 0 \iff \forall \alpha_i = 0$$
When a set is not linearly independent, it is said to be [[Linear Dependence|Linearly Dependent]].
