up:: [[Lorentz Group]]

Note that [[Lorentz Transformation]]s $\Lambda$ satisfy
$$
\Lambda \in O(1,3) \implies \det (\Lambda)^2 = 1
$$
The transformations with positive determinant belong to the **proper** Lorentz Group $SO(1,3)$. This amounts to saying, for a $x$-boost, that
$$
\gamma^2 - \gamma^2 \beta^2 = \pm 1 \iff \gamma^2 = \frac{\pm 1}{1 - \beta^2}
$$
whose negative version is not physically sound.
