up:: [[Image of Function]]

Given a function $f: X \to Y$, and noting that $f(X) \subset Y$, one can see that all points of $X$ are restricted to reach only the [[Image of Function|image]] of $f$ (not any point in $Y \setminus f(X)$).

Thus, every function $f: X \to Y$ can be seen as a [[Surjective Function]] $f: X \to f(X)$ when restricting its reach to its image only. 

This is also why [[Injective functions are bijective with respect to their image]].
