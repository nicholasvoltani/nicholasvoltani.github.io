Given a [[Category]] $C$, we say an object $T \in Ob(C)$ is a **terminal object** if all objects $x \in C$ have a morphism **to** $T$ from $x$. That is,

$$\forall x \in C: \exists f \in Mor(x, T): x \overset{f}{\to} T$$
# Properties
- A terminal object is an [[Initial Object]] in the [[Opposite Category]] $C^{op}$.
- [[A terminal object is isomorphic to an initial object if there is a morphism from T to I]].
- An initial object which is also terminal is called a [[Zero Object]].
