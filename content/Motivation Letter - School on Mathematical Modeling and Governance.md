# Intro
Scientists have not only the duty, but the strengths to partake in governance processes of public policies, lending their abilities of systematic and rational thinking. As Marx famously said, "If there were no difference between essence and appearance, there would be no need for science", which is why scientists make themselves so important where reality is more nuanced than meets the eye ─ and, in particular, where failing to recognize this implies in dangerous, even malicious, decision-making. To dispel such injustices, in favor of striving towards the common good via rational processes ─ that should be one of the duties of Science in society, whose increasing complexity demands complex frameworks more than ever.
# About me
As for me, I have a degree in Physics, I'm currently working in the insurance market and hoping to begin my Master's degree in Mathematics next year (most likely something with Category Theory). What moves me is interdisciplinarity, the refusal to restrict myself to only one area of knowledge when there are so many interesting realities out there ─ Physics, Maths, Philosophy, Ecology. My brief passage in the corporate world (although with one too many frustrations) has taught me about the importance of the governance of processes in practice: information transparency and clarity, peer reviews, reproducibility of results, and so forth. My Physics course allowed me to transit mainly between the Physics and Mathematics departments, while the Pandemic allowed me to take courses in the History and Social Communications departments as well ─ which helped me cast away, for good, the false pretension of only needing to interact with the world through a single scientific lens. What I've been accustomed to see throughout my Physics degree was a general condescendence towards Philosophy and philosophical thinking, putting mathematical logic above all else, when, in fact, it seems both complement each other: Mathematics teaches clearer thinking, and Philosophy pulls us back to real human problems (and to their complexity). 

The whole is more than the sum of its parts, and I can safely say that my experiences molded me such as to not shy away from difficult debates and conversations. I really enjoy learning new things and proving things for myself, in particular in Maths: the sense of "ownership" that comes from proving a result with "my own hands", so to say, is very satisfying. As far as this course goes, if I'm chosen to participate in it, I'll be able to fully commit to it during the week it'll take place (I'll be able to take a weekly leave on work for this), giving it my undivided attention.
