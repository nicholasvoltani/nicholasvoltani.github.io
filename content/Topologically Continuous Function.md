A function $f: (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$ mapping between topological spaces is said to be continuous if 
$$\forall A_Y \in \tau_Y, f^{-1}(A) \in \tau_X$$

That is, **it "premaps" open sets (from $Y$) to open sets (in $X$)**. 

# Relation to Metric Space continuous functions



# Corollaries
It can also be proven that [[Continuous functions premap closed sets to closed sets]].

A more motivated equivalent definition of continuity is that in which [[A continuous function's image of the closure is a subset of the closure of its image]], through which one can easily see that [[The closure of a continuous image of a closure is the closure of the image|Continuous functions map close inputs to close outputs]].
