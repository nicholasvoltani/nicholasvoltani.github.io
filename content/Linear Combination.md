up:: [[Vector Space]]

Given a vector space $(V, +, \cdot)$ and a subset $\{v_i\} \subset V$, we say that a vector $v$ is a **linear combination** of $\{v_i\}$ if there are coefficients $\{\alpha_i\}$ in the vector space's [[Field (Algebra)|Field]] such that
$$v = \sum\limits_i \alpha_i v_i$$
That is, $v$ can be decomposed into components of the vectors $\{v_i\}$.

- A subset of a vector space is [[Linear Dependence|Linearly Dependent]] if there is at least one vector inside it which is a linear combination of the other vectors
- A subset is [[Linear Independence|Linearly Independent]] if no vectors inside it are linear combinations of any other vectors.
