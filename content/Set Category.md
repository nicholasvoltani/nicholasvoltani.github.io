The category $Set$ is the category whose objects are **sets** $X$ and whose morphisms are **functions** $X \overset{f}{\to} Y$.
# Properties
- Note that, since for any set $X, Y$, the cardinality of the set of functions from $X$ to $Y$ is $|Y|^{|X|}$, we have that $Set$ is [[Locally Small Category|Locally Small]].
- It is **not** a [[Small Category]], since this would imply that the set of all sets is itself a set (which would violate [[Russell's Paradox]])
