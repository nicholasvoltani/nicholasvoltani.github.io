up:: [[Equivalence Class]]

Let $\sim$ be an [[Equivalence Relation]].

Let $[x], [y]$ two equivalence classes, and suppose that there is some point $z \in X$ in common to both.

Then $\forall x \in X, x \sim z$ and $\forall y \in Y, y \sim z \iff z \sim y$. But, by definition, $x \sim z \land z \sim y \implies x \sim y$.

Thus, all elements of $x$ are equivalent to $y$, and thus $[x] = [y]$.
