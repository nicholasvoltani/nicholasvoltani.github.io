Given a [[Category]] $C$, its opposite category $C^{op}$ is defined as $C$ but with all morphisms flipped. That is,
- $Ob(C^{op}) = Ob(C)$
- $\forall x, y \in Ob(C^{op}): Hom_{C^{op}}(x, y) = Hom_C(y, x)$

# Properties
- Any theorem proved for a category $C$ will also be valid for its opposite category $C^{op}$
