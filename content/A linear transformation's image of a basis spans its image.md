up:: [[Linear Transformation]]

Let $T: V \to W$ a linear transformation, and $B \subset V$ a [[Hamel Basis]].

Let $w \in T(V)$. Since it is in $T$'s image, then there is some vector $v \in V$ such that
$$w = T(v) = T\left(\sum_i \alpha_i v_i\right) = \sum_i \alpha_i T(v_i)$$
Thus, $Im T$ is spanned by $\{T(v_i)\}$.
