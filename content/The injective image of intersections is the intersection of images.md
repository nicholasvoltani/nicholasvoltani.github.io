up:: [[The image of the intersection is contained in the intersection of the images]]

When $f: X \to Y$ is an [[Injective Function]], we have, in particular, that[^1]
$$(\exists x \in A \mid f(x) = y) \; \land (\exists z \in B \mid f(z) = y) \implies (x = z) \implies \exists x \in A \cap B \mid f(x) = y$$
thus proving the reciprocal $f(A) \cap f(B) \subseteq f(A \cap B)$.

[^1]: That is due to $\forall y \in Y, {\color{red} \exists!} x \in X \mid f(x) = y$.
