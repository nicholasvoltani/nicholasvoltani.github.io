Let $S \subseteq X$ be a subset of a [[Topological Space]] $(X, \tau)$.

Let $\partial S$ be its [[Boundary (Topology)|Boundary]]. Then its boundary will be
$$\partial \partial S = \overline{\partial S} \setminus \mathring{\partial S}$$
Since [[The boundary is a closed set]], this is equal to
$$\partial \partial S = \partial S \setminus \mathring{\partial S}$$


# $\mathring{\partial S} = \emptyset \implies \partial\partial S = \partial S$
Since the boundary has an empty interior by hypothesis, this yields
$$\partial \partial S = \partial S$$
# $\partial\partial S = \partial S \implies \mathring{\partial S} = \emptyset$
Suppose $\partial \partial S = \partial S$. Then
$$\partial \partial S = \partial S \setminus \mathring{\partial S} = \partial S$$
which can only hold if $\mathring{\partial S} = \emptyset$ ─because else, we'd only have that [[The boundary of the boundary is a subset of the boundary]] $\partial \partial S \subset \partial S$, differing by at least one point.
