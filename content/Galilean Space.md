up:: [[Galilean Space-time Structure]]

A Galilean Space $(E, V, \left<\cdot, \cdot\right>$) is an [[Affine Space]] with a [[Galilean Space-time Structure]] â”€ that is, a space in which
1. Events are points in a four-dimensional affine space $E$
2. Time intervals are measured for the separation vectors between events via a function $t: V \to \mathbb{R}$
3. Distances are only measured between [[Simultaneous Events (Galilean)|Simultaneous Event]]s, using the [[Euclidean Structure]]

# Relation to coordinate space
Consider the [[Galilean Coordinate Space]], which is the
