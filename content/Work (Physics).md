Given a force $\vec{F}$ which acts upon a body, one can calculate the work it exerts **through a given path $L$** as the line integral
$$
W_L = \int_L \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{l}
$$

Given a parameterization of $L$ via $\gamma(t)$, one can write the work done over $\gamma$ as
$$
W_L = \int_{t_0}^{t_f}\vec{F}(\gamma(t))\cdot \vec{\gamma}'(t) \,dt
$$
with $\vec{\gamma}'(t)$ being its derivative with respect to $t$.
# Properties
- [[The work of resultant forces equals the difference in kinetic energy]]
- [[Work of conservative forces is the opposite of potential energy difference]]
