Given a [[Category]] $C$, we say an object $I \in Ob(C)$ is an **initial object** if all objects $x \in C$ have a morphism **from** $I$ to $x$. That is,

$$\forall x \in C: \exists f \in Mor(I, x): I \overset{f}{\to}x$$
# Properties
- An initial object is a [[Terminal Object]] in the [[Opposite Category]] $C^{op}$.
- [[A terminal object is isomorphic to an initial object if there is a morphism from T to I]].
- An initial object which is also terminal is called a [[Zero Object]].
