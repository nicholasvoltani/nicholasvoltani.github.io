up:: [[Finitely Generated Vector Space]]

A (finitely generated) vector space $(V, +, \cdot)$ is said to have dimension equal to $n$ if it has any [[Hamel Basis]] with $n$ elements[^1]. We denote it $\dim V = n$.

[^1]: And this is unambiguous, since [[All Hamel bases have the same number of elements (in a finitely generated vector space)]].
