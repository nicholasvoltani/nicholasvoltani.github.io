Given a [[Topological Space]] $(X, \tau)$, the boundary of a set $Z$ \subset X is the set subtraction of its [[Closure (Topology)|Closure]] by its [[Interior (Topology)|Interior]]. This amounts to it consisting of the **outermost points of $Z$**.

$$
\partial(Z) = \overline{Z} \setminus \mathring{Z}
$$

# Properties
- [[The boundary is a closed set]]
- [[The boundary of the set is the boundary of its complement]]
- [[The boundary of the boundary is a subset of the boundary]]
	- [[The boundary of the boundary is the boundary iff the boundary's interior is empty]]
