For a [[Differentiable function]] $\vec{F}: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$, the divergence theorem states that, for a given closed surface $S$,
$$
\oint \limits_{ S} \vec{F}\cdot \vec{dS} = \iiint\limits_{V} \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \,\,dV
$$

That is, the [[Flux of a vector field]] through a closed surface is equal to the [[Divergence]] of the vector field inside the surface's volume.
