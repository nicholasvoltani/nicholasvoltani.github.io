Given a [[Group (Mathematics)|Group]] $G$ and a [[Normal Subgroup]] $N \trianglelefteq G$, we define the quotient group as the set of all left-[[Coset]] of $N$.
$$
G/N \equiv \{gN \mid g \in G\}
$$

Its group operation is defined as
$$
(gN)(hN) \equiv (gh)N
$$

## Equivalence relation defined by $N$
[[A quotient group induces an equivalence relation upon its base group]], since, by thinking about $N$ as the set of "identity elements", then all elements "connected" by an element of $N$ will be equivalent.
