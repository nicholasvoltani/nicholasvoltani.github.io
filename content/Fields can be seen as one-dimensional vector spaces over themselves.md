Note that, given a [[Field (Algebra)|Field]] $\mathbb{K}$, one can construct a [[Vector Space]] $(\mathbb{K}, +, \cdot)$ trivially. Note that all of its elements can be generated by a [[Spanning Set]] $\{1\} \subset \mathbb{K}$. 

In fact, it can be generated by any non-null element of $\mathbb{K}$, since any other element can be generated from it by dividing by it (since it's not $0$) and multiplying by the element in the field to generate the element in the vector space.
