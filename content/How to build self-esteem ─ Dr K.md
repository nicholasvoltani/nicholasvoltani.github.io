# How to build self-esteem ─ Dr K
## First of: How do we *lose* self-esteem?
### Where does *unconditional love* come from?
1. It comes from *other people*;
	1. Emotional mirroring can have an impact on this (a kid falls, his parent overreacts such as "Oh my God, are you OK??")
2. You start to lose unconditional love
3. People start to have expectations on us (as in "my love is, actually, **conditional**")

But self-esteem is our steem for **ourselves**, not from other people; so, how does the external factors influence on our SELF-esteem?

## Internalization of external expectations
When we turn external, **particular** expectations upon us as intrinsic, **general** expectations that we, in particular, also fall under. 
> "And once I attach my value to an external outcome, that's when self-esteem gets shot."

One of the fastest ways to develop self-esteem is **from other people** (as in praise, compliments, etc), although we tend to filter them out from the given circumstances (like parents being like that normally and not really meaning much). Cultivating people that appreciate who you are. 

### *Believing the internalization* decreases self-esteem
Think about the way you judge yourself: where did you come up with the **standard** to your judgment? Is it logical? Is it different from the judgment on others? 

So there's this process of piecing out **who I am** and **what I internalized from outside**. 

**Case example**: being rejected can be rationalized as "being unlovable". The ego comes in and starts defining you this way; you stop thinking about external factors: I've internalized the external factors, and now other external factors act as **further proof**. 

## Being critical of internalized expectations, and how I came to believe in them
Dismantling the identification with those external factors.

## Self-blaming as throwing oneself in a rut
- Something goes wrong
- "Oh I'm an idiot, that's why! Guess I can't change, that's how it goes! Boohoo!"
- Gets absolved of the responsability of doing anything about it
- Remains in problematic situation
