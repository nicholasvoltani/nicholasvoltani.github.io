up:: [[Linear Independence]]

Given a vector space $(V, +, \cdot)$, a set $S \subseteq V$ is said to be **linearly dependent** if it is not [[Linear Independence|Linearly Independent]] ─ that is, if there is at least one vector $v \in S$ such that it is the [[Linear Combination]] of the other vectors.
