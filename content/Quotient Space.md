up:: [[Equivalence Relation]]

Given a set $X$ and an [[Equivalence Relation]] $\sim$, the set of the [[Equivalence Class]]es 
$$
X/\sim = \{[x] \mid x \in X\}
$$
is called its quotient space.

Note that each equivalence class can be seen as different elements from each other, since [[All equivalence classes are disjoint]].

# Examples of quotient spaces
$\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0, 1\}$ can be seen as $\mathbb{Z} / \sim$ with 
$$
m \sim n \iff m \bmod 2 = n\bmod2
$$
Thus, $0 := [0] = \{n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n \bmod 2 = 0\}$ and $1 := [1] = \{n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n \bmod 2 = 1\}$.
